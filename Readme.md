<Loyal Customers Prediction to give Payback Event Encouraging Additional Purchase>
- Conducted experiment whether proposing overcharge with payback (amounts diverse from 7k to 10k) leads to additional profit.
- Designed/launched A/B test on a budget of $ 57,000 by predicting 130k users who have low probability to overcharge (using user analysis and ML model to cherry pick user segment).
- Generated 48% of more users to overcharge and achieved 173% ROI with figuring out an optimal payback amount.

• <Real-time Abuser Detection and Point Penalty System> Constructed real-time abuser detecting models (using Kafka, Flink and LightGBM) predicting over 150K/day users and figured out 20K abusers every hour. By providing point penalty system utilizing model output, managed to keep abusers from monetizing approximately $420,000/yr. Designed KPI metric to quantify a service effect as a monetizing value.

• <Abuser Access-Interrupt Action System> Optimizing policy and strategy of access-interrupt action service by conducting data-driven process with full responsibility at a product owner level. Affected over 2k/day abusers in a day and achieved to prevent abusers from earning an average monthly profit of $ 24,000/yr. Proposed solution with algorithm for recommending the target group of access-interrupt action that could extend target to 5k/day and blocked monetized profit to over $ 80,000/yr. (Increased daily throughput of target up to 250% and 333% of monetization performance).
